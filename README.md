YouRecoHide is a simple yet effective Chrome extension that improves your focus by hiding YouTube recommendations, other users' playlists, and the tab list while you're watching videos. This ensures that you're not distracted by unrelated content and can focus on what's important.

## Features

- **Hide YouTube Recommendations:** Automatically hides all video recommendations displayed on the side while watching YouTube videos.
- **Hide Playlists from Other Users:** Ensures that only your playlists are visible while hiding playlists from other users.
- **Hide Tab List:** The tab list containing "Up Next" videos is also hidden to minimize distractions.
- **Toggle On/Off:** Use the toggle switch in the popup to enable or disable the feature anytime.
- **Persistent State:** The extension remembers whether it was last enabled or disabled, even after closing the browser.

## How It Works

### Background Process

The extension works by inserting a content script into YouTube pages. This script manipulates the DOM to hide certain elements, including recommendations, external playlists, and the tab list. The extension's state (enabled/disabled) is stored in Chrome's sync cache, allowing it to persist across browser sessions and devices.

### User Interface

The user interface consists of a simple popup with a toggle switch:

- **Toggle Switch:** Allows the user to enable or disable the hiding of YouTube recommendations. The switch's state is synchronized with the stored state in Chrome's storage.
- **Text Indicator:** Displays "Toggle On" or "Toggle Off" based on the current state of the extension.

### Content Script

The content script (`content.js`) handles the DOM manipulation:

- **hideYouTubeRecommendations:** This function hides YouTube recommendations, external playlists, and the tab list.
- **showYouTubeRecommendations:** This function restores the hidden elements when the extension is disabled.
- **State Management:** The extension checks the stored state on page load and applies the corresponding function (hide/show).

### Storage

The extension uses Chrome's `sync` storage to save the state (`isEnabled`). This allows the extension to remember whether it was last enabled or disabled, even if the browser is closed and reopened.
